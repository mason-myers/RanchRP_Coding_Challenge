# RanchRP Coding Challenge

This resource works with RedM. It spawns in a surgeon who can change your ped model! The Ped spawns in the doctors office of Valentine. You can walk up to him, press f, select the model you want, and watch yourself be transformed! After you have done this, your scars need time to heal, so you have a 10 minute timer before your doctor will operate on you again.

Feel free to use this wherever, it has not been super optimized, but it works well. I have documented the heck out of it so you know what I was thinking when I was creating it.

Thank you for reading and have fun with it!
